# Smite Stats Tier List 
A Smite character tier list that functions by pitting individual extracted data from a csv file against each other. 
 It then assigns each data a tier value, and each god a tier based on the data tier value. This is done by seeing how many high tiers a god has achieved and then comparing it to other gods!
This all comes to a conclusion in a local device website ran from Command Prompt where the tier list is displayed and a new champ of your own can be added as well!!
-----TO RUN----
Take the file path and paste it into the command prompt. Then use "py app.py" to run and give you the URL. 
!Enjoy!
